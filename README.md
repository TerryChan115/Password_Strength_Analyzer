Entropy calculation: Measures password complexity based on character diversity

Cracking time estimation: Predicts how long it would take to brute-force the password

Visual feedback: Color-coded progress bar and strength indicators

Password visibility toggle: Option to reveal entered password

Criteria checklist: Shows which security requirements are met

Requirements
